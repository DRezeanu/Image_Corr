# Image_Corr
Unsupervised learning algorithm for evaluating the responses of midget retinal ganglion cell receptive fields.

Model uses Neitz lab photopigment templates to generate cone fundamentals, simulate putative midget RGC receptive fields, and evaluate the receptive fields' responses to the edges in an RGB image. 

The output is a matrix that shows the correlations between the response patterns of all 8 of the putative receptive fields tested.
